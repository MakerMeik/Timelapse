# Timelapse
Simple bash-script for a timelapse-cron-job and an optimized version of the camera web server example from the Arduino library, which reconnects in case of Wi-Fi disconnections.

Update 2025-02-18: Added "get_current_advanced.sh". It allows you to capture images with a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi HQ cam. Thanks to the better image sensor, higher resolutions and even long exposures for night shots can be realized. 
The “sunwait” tool from risacher is used to automatically determine sunrise and sunset (https://github.com/risacher/sunwait).
